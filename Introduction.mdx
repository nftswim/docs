## Personal Intelligence Network (PIN)
PIN AI is an open platform for Personal AI, empowering users to reclaim their data from centralized platforms and train private, on-device AI models. The PIN Network integrates private compute, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), and blockchain verification to ensure secure interactions between humans and AI.

Additionally, PIN AI serves as an economic coordination layer for Personal AI and AI agents, enabling developers to access contextual data through privacy-preserving protocols and build AI Agent services that translate user intents into real-world actions.
