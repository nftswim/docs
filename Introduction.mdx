## Personal Intelligence Network (PIN)
PIN AI is an open platform for Personal AI, enabling users to own and control their personal data while training and deploying AI models tailored to their needs. The PIN AI Network combines on-device computation, TEE security, and blockchain verification to enable seamless interactions between humans and AI agents, all mediated by Personal AI.

Additionally, PIN AI serves as a coordination layer, connecting users to a marketplace of specialized AI agents that can book appointments, analyze data, manage finances, and simplify daily digital tasksâ€”all while preserving privacy.
