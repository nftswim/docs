## Personal Intelligence Network (PIN)
PIN AI is the open platform for Personal AI, enabling users to own and control their personal data while training and deploying their own AI models tailored to their needs. The PIN AI Network combines on-device computation, TEE security, and blockchain verification to enable seamless interactions between humans and AI Agents, all mediated by Personal AI.

Additionally, PIN AI serves as a coordination layer, connecting user Personal AI to a marketplace of specialized AI agents that offer services such as automation, finance, and data processing. This open marketplace ensures agents compete fairly through secure smart contract interactions, without data monopolization or privacy risks.
