The PIN token is the native asset of the PIN AI economy, facilitating secure, decentralized AI interactions and data management. It provides utility to the network across the following use cases. 
### Network security
PIN Network Validators stake PIN to secure the blockchain, ensuring reliable data transactions and service validation. They receive token rewards for maintaining the network's integrity. 

### Data handling and processing
Secure and private data handling is incentivized through PIN staking and rewards:
- TEE Node Operators stake PIN to ensure data service reliability and economic security, earning rewards for securely retrieving, verifying, and processing user data.
- TEE Node Operators earn PIN rewards for maintaining a trusted compute environment, providing resources, and generating cryptographic attestations.

### Agent services
Agent service providers stake PIN tokens to access user requests and ensure service reliability. They earn PIN rewards for successfully fulfilling requests based on performance metrics.

### Personal AI points
PIN AI app users earn PIN rewards based on their engagement with their Personal AI and data contributions within the PIN AI ecosystem. Rewards are allocated according to the usefulness, quality, and timeliness of the data they provide.

### Governance
PIN token holders play an active role in the decentralized governance of the PIN AI ecosystem, voting on key proposals and shaping the platform's development.
