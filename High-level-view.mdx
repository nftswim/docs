## The problem with today's AI
Current AI applications, like ChatGPT, Google Assistant, and Siri, fail to deliver truly personalized AI services. This is because they lack the personal context needed to understand you as an individual.

Your digital identity is fragmented across Big Tech’s walled gardens—Apple, Google, Meta—where each company holds only a piece of your data within their closed ecosystems. This fragmented data ecosystem, where data cannot be shared across platforms, not only prevents AI applications from providing truly personalized services, but also:

- Centralizes control over personal data within corporate silos, restricting user autonomy and creating barriers to true data ownership.
- Enforces an exploitative model where Big Tech monetizes your data for AI training and advertising while you receive no ownership, compensation, or control.

## The path to personal AI

PIN AI (Personal Intelligence Network) solves data fragmentation and unlocks truly personal AI by putting you back in control of your data. We believe that Personal AI—a decentralized on-device personal intelligence system that benefits you—is the key to ensuring AI remains aligned with you. To achieve this, AI must learn from your individual preferences and interactions, not just internet data.

Our platform combines decentralized data ownership, secure edge computing with TEE protection, and personalized AI modeling to transform how you interact with AI services.

With PIN AI, you can:

- Reclaim and consolidate your fragmented data from Big Tech’s closed ecosystems, mobile internet apps, and blockchain-related data sources.
- Fine-tune and run Personal AI models directly on your mobile device.
- Participate in a Personal AI service economy where you benefit from your data's value.
