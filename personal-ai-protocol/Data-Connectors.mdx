title: 'What are Data Connectors?'
---
Data Connectors are software-based components that fetch and organize user data from external sources into a structured format that on-device LLMs can utilize for Personal AI and agent services. They are hosted by a decentralized network of TEE Node Operators and are accessible to users via the PIN AI app.

Connectors provide the following services:
- Secure data collection from sources like social media, email, Web3 wallets, and shopping apps.
- Private data preprocessing within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).
- Cryptographic attestation of data preprocessing, verified by the PIN Onchain Protocol.

## How they work

Users select Data Connectors to collect and preprocess their data so that it is readily accessible to their Personal AI. The process consists of the following steps:

### Data collection

1. Connectors securely fetch and process user data from authorized sources (e.g., social media, Web3 wallets, shopping apps), ensuring privacy and preventing unauthorized access.

    - Verified data sources (Gmail, social media, e-commerce, crypto wallets, etc.).
    - Interaction history and past responses.
    - Activity patterns and behavioral trends.

### Preprocessing

2. Retrieved data is cleaned, formatted, and structured into a graph, optimizing it for efficient retrieval and AI processing.

### Onchain verification

3. Connectors ensure the integrity and authenticity of operations performed within TEE nodes by submitting a hardware-generated attestation report to the PIN Onchain Protocol. These reports confirm that:

    - The TEE node has completed the assigned task.
    - The code running inside the TEE is the version certified by the Personal AI Protocol, ensuring no alterations to the software or environment.

    These attestation reports are submitted to the PIN Onchain Protocol for verification, ensuring that:

    - The TEE environment operates as intended and securely processes personal data.
    - The integrity of the software and Data Connectors' operations is maintained without exposing sensitive user information.

### Storage

4. After verification, preprocessed data is securely stored in a user-designated trusted storage space. This storage could be the userâ€™s local devices or private cloud. This ensures privacy, local control, and direct accessibility for Personal AI.

## Important features

**Privacy-preserving data handling:**
All data fetching and processing occur exclusively within a TEE node, unless otherwise authorized by the user. This prevents unauthorized access or data leakage.

**User-controlled access:**
Users retain full control over which Data Connectors can access their apps and under what conditions. Data fetching is customizable based on user-defined parameters, such as scheduled updates or on-demand fetching.
