The Personal AI Protocols aligns economic incentives with robust security measures to maintain a sustainable and trustworthy data connector ecosystem. It ensures fair compensation for participants while enforcing mechanisms that prevent spam, low-quality data submissions, and fraudulent behavior.

## Cost efficiency
- The operational cost for data connectors is lowâ€”processing a request costs approximately $0.001.

## Token rewards for data contributions
- Users receive token rewards based on the quality, timeliness, and usefulness of their data.
- A decay formula prevents inflation by reducing rewards as more data is contributed.

## Identity verification & anti-sybil mechanisms
- **Encrypted identifiers**: User identifiers (e.g., email, accounts) are encrypted with a common public key.
- **Privacy-preserving verification**: The private key remains unknown, ensuring that no personal information is exposed.
- **Duplicate detection**: If a duplicate encrypted identifier is linked to another account, the submission is automatically rejected.
