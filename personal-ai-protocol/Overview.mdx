The Personal AI Protocol is an open-source, decentralized framework that combines cryptographic security with off-chain private computation to enable secure, verifiable, and privacy-preserving data handling. It empowers you to unlock your data from various Web2 and Web3 platforms and leverage it with your own Personal AI.

The protocol consists of three core components: **Data Connectors**, **On-Device LLMs**, and **God Models.**

## Data Connectors

Data Connectors are software components that securely fetch, process, and structure personal data within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). They enable you to connect to and retrieve information from major Web2 and Web3 platforms, such as Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon, MetaMask, and Phantom, while ensuring data privacy and user control.

Additionally, Data Connectors process and structure your data into a personal knowledge graph, making it easily accessible and optimized for use by your Personal AI.

### Data Connectors help you
- Select specific sources to fetch only the data you need.
- Store fetched data in a trusted location of your choice.
- Control your Personal AI’s access and use of your data.

<Info>A TEE is a secure area within a device's main processor that prevents external processes from accessing or altering the data inside. For more information about TEEs, <a href="/Infrastructure/TEE-Nodes">visit here</a>.</Info>

## On-Device LLMs (Personal AI)

On-device Large Language Models (LLMs) are self-contained, privacy-preserving AI models that run directly on your devices—smartphones, laptops, or private clouds—via the PIN AI app. On-device LLMs process data directly on your device or in a secure, user-authorized environment. This keeps your data private and under your control.

Your on-device LLM transforms into your Personal AI by accessing data fetched by Data Connectors and stored locally in your trusted location. By learning your history, preferences, and behavior, it generates context-aware insights and acts within and across your mobile apps to assist with daily tasks.

### Personal AI helps you
- Streamline your digital life with AI-powered automation.
- Interact with AI agents across the PIN Economy. 
- Receive personalized insights and recommendations tailored to you.

## God Models

Guardain of data (God) Models are a TEE-based specialized models that evaluate the performance and accuracy of Personal AIs, ensuring they effectively serve user needs. This process rewards users for having high-quality Personal AIs that accurately represent their data.

### Key features
- Operate securely within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).
- Specialize in evaluating Personal AI performance.
- Verify the accuracy and consistency of Personal AI responses.

<Info>Interactions between your Personal AI and our God Models remain private—accessible only to you and the respective God Model.</Info>
