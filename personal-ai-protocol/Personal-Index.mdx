A Personal Index is a private, always-updating knowledge graph stored on a user's device or in a private cloud. It organizes personal data—like notes, messages, and files—so the Personal AI can better understand habits, preferences, and context, all while keeping data secure.

### Personal Indexes provide

- **Smarter personalization**: Personal Indexes organize user data, enabling on-device LLMs to recognize patterns and context for more relevant and adaptive responses.
- **Continuous improvement**: Personal Indexes evolve in real time, continuously adapting to the user’s changing needs and preferences.
## How do they work?

We use an on-device language model to turn raw documents into a knowledge graph. This approach (often called GraphRAG) works by:

1. **Extracting entities and relationships**: The on-device language model reviews text and locates people, places, concepts, and how they connect.
2. **Indexing with graphs and vectors**: Important facts are stored in a graph database for structured retrieval, and vector embeddings help the AI Agent quickly find relevant information.

### Advantages

- More accurate, context-aware answers.
- Fewer incorrect responses (hallucinations).
- Scalable for complex data without leaking privacy.
