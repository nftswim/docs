The PIN AI App allows users to contribute to the network and earn Personal AI Points by connecting their personal data via various Data Connectors. Actively training and refining Personal AI models further increases point earning potential.

## Base rewards

Base Rewards provide users with incentives for connecting and updating their data through qualified data connectors.

### First-time connection rewards

Users can receive rewards the first time they connect their data to the PIN AI app.

- **Requirement:** To mitigate spam, PIN AI only accepts the email accounts with at least X days of history and Y number of emails.
- **Scoring System:**
    - The first email per wallet contributes 1 point.
    - Subsequent emails reduce in weight: 0.5 for the second, 0.25 for the third, etc.
- **Decay Rate:** Rewards decay by 50% every three cycles. This means once the total score reaches 450K, the reward per contribution is halved.
