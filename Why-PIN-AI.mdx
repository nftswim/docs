title: 'Why PIN AI?'

## The Problem with today's AI
Current AI applications, like ChatGPT, Google Assistant, and Siri fail to deliver truly personalized AI services. This is because they lack the personal context needed to understand you as an individual.

Your digital identity is fragmented across Big Tech’s walled gardens—Apple, Google, Meta—where each company holds only a piece of your data within their closed ecosystems. This fragmented data ecosystem, where data cannot be shared across platforms, not only prevents AI applications from providing truly personalized services but also

- Centralizes corporate control over personal data, limiting user autonomy and restricting true data ownership.
- Enforces an exploitative data economy, where Big Tech monetizes your data for AI training and targeted advertising, while you receive no ownership, compensation, or control.

## Unlocking personal AI

PIN AI solves data fragmentation and unlocks personal AI with an open platform for data ownership and personal intelligence. The platform enables you to securely reclaim your data from centralized platforms, deploy AI models on your mobile device, and access an open economy of AI Agent services.

Additionally, PIN AI offers builders a privacy-first data layer to create innovative AI applications.

**PIN AI empowers you to**

- Reclaim and consolidate your fragmented data from Big Tech’s closed ecosystems, mobile apps, and blockchain sources while maintaining your privacy.
- Fine-tune and run personal AI models directly on your personal devices.
- Participate in an open AI economy, where you control and benefit from your data.
