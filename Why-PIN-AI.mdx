title: 'Why PIN AI?'

## The Problem with today's AI
Current AI, such as ChatGPT, Siri, and Google Assistant, cannot provide truly personalized experiences because they lack the necessary context to understand individual users.

User data is fragmented across Big Tech’s platforms—Apple, Google, Meta—where each company controls only a portion of your data within closed ecosystems. This fragmentation prevents AI applications from delivering personalized intelligence and instead reinforces:

- Centralized corporate control over personal data, limiting user autonomy and restricting true data ownership.
- An exploitative data economy, where technology corporations monetize your data for AI training and targeted advertising, while you receive no compensation or control.

## Unlocking personal AI

PIN AI solves data fragmentation and unlocks personal AI with an open platform for data ownership and personal intelligence. The platform enables you to securely reclaim your data from centralized platforms, deploy AI models on your mobile device, and access an open economy of AI Agent services.

Additionally, PIN AI offers builders a privacy-first data layer to create innovative AI applications.

### PIN AI empowers you to

- Reclaim and consolidate your fragmented data from Big Tech’s closed ecosystems, mobile apps, and blockchain sources while maintaining your privacy.
- Fine-tune and run personal AI models directly on your personal devices.
- Participate in an open AI economy, where you control and benefit from your data.
