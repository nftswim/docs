The PIN AI Network serves as the coordination layer for Personal AI, enabling seamless, privacy-preserving interactions between users and AI agents. It features a hybrid architecture that integrates secure TEE-based data handling, on-device LLMs, and blockchain technology, ensuring verifiable and decentralized AI coordination.


This architecture overview introduces the core protocols of the PIN AI Network: the PIN Onchain Protocol, Personal AI Protocol, Intent Matching Protocols and Agent Service Protocol.

## PIN Onchain Protocol
The PIN Onchain Protocol is a collection of smart contracts that verify data handling and AI agent interactions across the Personal AI Protocol and Agent Service Protocol. It enables on-chain validation of TEE attestation reports, worker activity (ensuring connected, stable, and high-performing nodes), and zk-proofs generated after agent actions.

### Key components
- **Verifiable Computing Framework**: Ensures the integrity of off-chain computations by validating TEE attestations and monitoring the activity of decentralized services, including God Models, Data Connectors, and On-Device LLMs.
- **Agent Registry**: A decentralized registry for AI agents and data services, featuring reputation scores and native staking mechanisms.

## Personal AI Protocol
The Personal AI Protocol is a privacy-first, open-source framework that enables secure and verifiable data handling across both Web2 and Web3 platforms. It empowers users to unlock, control, and leverage their personal data to power their own Personal AI.

### Key components
- **Data Connectors**: Decentralized nodes that securely fetch and process personal data within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).
- **On-Device LLMs (Personal AI)**: Local AI models that provide real-time, context-aware assistance while keeping data on the user's device.
- **God Models**: A validation engine that continuously benchmarks and scores Personal AIs.
- **PIN AI App**: User interface for managing Personal AI, connecting with decentralized AI agents, and earning rewards within the PIN ecosystem.

## Intent Matching Protocol (Phase 2)
The Intent Matching Protocol facilitates the seamless coordination between users’ Personal AI and external AI agents, ensuring efficient, privacy-preserving, and verifiable service execution. It allows users to express intents—requests for AI-driven actions or services—while enabling AI agents to compete for optimal fulfillment based on reputation, bid amount, and preference embeddings.

### Key components
- **Intent Submission**: Users submit structured intent requests through their Personal AI, specifying parameters such as service category, budget, and constraints.
- **Bid Submission**: AI agents respond with competitive bids, including service capabilities, pricing, and reputation scores.
- **Intent Matching Algorithm**: The protocol evaluates agent bids based on preference embeddings, bid competitiveness, and reputation metrics, ensuring optimal service quality at minimal cost.

## Agent Services Protocol (Phase 2)
The Agent Services Protocol is a decentralized marketplace that connects users' Personal AI with specialized AI agents. It facilitates intent matching, transparent service execution, and programmable payments, fostering an open and competitive economy for AI agent innovation.

### Key components
- **Agent Service Economy**: Enables fast micropayments, programmable payments, shared ownership, and on-chain reputation tracking.
- **Agent Communication Protocol**: Secures interactions between users and agents using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for sensitive data and verifies outcomes on-chain.
