TEE Node Operators host and provide confidential compute for Data Connectors, enabling secure data retrieval and processing while preserving user privacy.

## Core functions

These functions ensure that sensitive data remains protected throughout its lifecycle:

- **Secure data fetching**: Implements end-to-end encrypted data retrieval from various sources.
- **Privacy-preserving processing**: Ensures data processing occurs entirely within TEE.
- **Access control**: Manages fine-grained permissions and audit logging.

## Key components

The following components enable secure data ingestion, processing, and privacy protection within the TEE environment:

### Data ingestion layer:
Manages the secure retrieval of external data while ensuring authenticity, integrity, and controlled access.

- **Encrypted Data Transport**: Utilizes TLS, end-to-end encryption, and cryptographic signatures to prevent data leaks.
- **Source Authentication**: Verifies data provenance to prevent unauthorized sources from injecting malicious data.
- **Rate Limiting & Quota Management**: Ensures controlled data access to prevent abuse and maintain system efficiency.

### Processing pipeline:
Handles data transformation and secure computation within the enclave to maintain confidentiality.

- **Data validation & sanitization**: Filters and normalizes incoming data to prevent injection attacks.
- **Format conversion & normalization**: Converts data into a standardized format for secure processing.
- **TEE-Based secure computation**: Executes privacy-preserving algorithms within the enclave.

### Privacy protection measures:
Implements security mechanisms to minimize data exposure and enforce privacy features.

- **Data minimization**: Limits the amount of data stored or processed.
- **Attribute-based encryption (ABE)**: Restricts access based on predefined policies.
- **Secure multi-party computation (MPC) Support**: Enables privacy-preserving collaboration without revealing raw data.

*The following Go structs define the TEE-based Data Connector architecture, ensuring secure data retrieval, processing, and privacy enforcement.*

```go
type DataConnector struct {
    ID          string
    Source      DataSource
    Permissions AccessControl
    Encryption  EncryptionConfig
}

type DataSource interface {
    // Fetches data securely from source
    FetchData(ctx context.Context) ([]byte, error)
    // Validates data integrity
    ValidateData(data []byte) error
    // Processes data within TEE
    ProcessInTEE(data []byte) ([]byte, error)
}

type PrivacyConfig struct {
    // Defines what data can be accessed
    AllowedAttributes []string
    // Defines data retention policy
    RetentionPeriod time.Duration
    // Defines data usage policies
    UsagePolicy Policy
}
```
